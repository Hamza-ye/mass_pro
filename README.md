# Project Name

## Overview
This project aims to create a Flutter-based clone of the Android Capture App for DHIS 2. The original app, built with Kotlin, utilizes the dhis2-android-sdk, which abstracts the complexity of interacting with the DHIS2 web API. Our goal is to replicate the functionalities of the original app using Flutter and the d2fsam-flutter-sdk, a customized version of the DHIS2 SDK developed for Flutter.

## Motivation
This project serves as an opportunity to deepen our understanding of the DHIS API and Flutter framework. By undertaking this project, we aim to gain hands-on experience in working with DHIS2 api and explore the capabilities of Flutter for cross-platform app development.

## Key Features
- Abstraction of DHIS2 web API interactions
- Offline functionality for data entry tasks

## Dependencies
- d2fsam-flutter-sdk: Forked and customized version of the DHIS2 SDK for Flutter

## Disclaimer
This project is a work in progress and may not fully replicate all functionalities of the original Android Capture App for DHIS 2. Contributions and feedback are encouraged to improve the project.
